# Shotgun Player

## What's it ?

Shotgun Player is a functional mock-up of what Shotgun could be if it would integrate a player directly on its website allowing to discover the artists playing at an event before making a purchase.

## How to run it (locally) ?

First, make sure you have followed the instructions for the back-end.  

If not, you will find the instructions [here](https://github.com/yungkittty/shotgun-player-api/blob/master/README.md).  

Now for the front-end. First, clone the repository.  

```
git clone https://github.com/yungkittty/shotgun-player.git
```

Once this is done, make sure to install the dependencies.  

```
npm install

Or

yarn install

```

Then start the back-end local server. (ie shotgun-player-api README.md)  

Then start the front-end local server.  

```
npm run start
```

It should work!  

## Are there stories not done ?

I think all the stories have been done.

## Are there edges not handled ?

I think all the edges have been handled (at least the ones I know).
